## Welcome to the Miscallenous Source Files folder!
- This folder is our collaboration point for pseudocode, and source code for work not yet a part of the android application.

#### Use this folder for things like:
- Uploading code of yours that needs testing out by the group. E.g. Your algorithms etc...
- Uploading code of yours that needs implementation into the android application. For example, your own .JAR files or other essential modules.

#### Thanks!
