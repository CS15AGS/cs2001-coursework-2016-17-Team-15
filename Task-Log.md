### Welcome to the Task-Log!
- *What is it:* Notes down all tasks that the group has done/not done, and who is doing which task. 
- It will help us to organize ourselves better and keep track of the work which needs to be done.
- It should also allow us to distribute tasks accordingly and discuss who is doing who.
- It can also be used as a reference file which can be used in the portfolio to find out the tasks you did.

#### Please use the following structures/formats as seen below
- To add to the file, simply add a paragraph for each task.
