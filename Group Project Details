CS2001 Year 2 Group Project (Update 20/10/16)

Current Application
Brunel E-Buyer for Students, which allow people to post information about their items online, preferably in a server backend which others can view for their purchasing pleasure.

Current Features

Verifying Student Identity/Accounts
- We thought it would be appropriate that since the app is exclusive to Brunel students, it would
Be better if the app connected to a Brunel server to verify their identity. It would also make it a safer app to use, and can allow the server to cope with a much lower demand of usage.
- Would it be possible to log in with FB?
- Contact details involve: Name, pic, phone number, email, option to hide from public, used to make transactions.

Search Option
- It may need a search bar/menu, possibly with an intuitive interface which allows people to look for their items.
- Can use tags to make finding the relevant items easier.
- Category bar which organizes search findings
- Sorting via relevance/price etc.

Multiple Screens
- A screen enabling the user to upload their own items to the application.
- A screen enabling the user to see what others are selling.
- A screen which can display information about the user/other users/account information.
- Login screen 

Online Chat
- Useful to establish better communication between buyers.
- Subject to abuse? As a result filter out words?

Vendor ratings and customer reviews
- Allow customers to be able to voice opinion on different vendors in order to improve quality of goods/behaviour or vendor.

Transactions
- No transactions using paypal/debit, app is simply a way to advertise sellerâ€™s items.
- Instead students meet up on set locations in campus only, decided by group to ensure safety.
- To aid this method of transaction, may be helpful to use printable receipts with the given transaction information.
- Would storing transaction receipts in the server help? For further evidence/reference if a transaction goes wrong?

Push Notifications
- Convenient way of notifying buyers/sellers on updates to their products.

Analytics
- Provide a better experience for who is using the application by looking at their shopping/browsing history.
- Privacy concerns?

Encryption
- Since students will likely provide their personal and student information within the application and between the servers, it is likely to provide adequate protection from spoofing/MITM which can compromise information.

In-App Purchases
- Buyers could donate/purchase to be able to get their items on top?
- May give only a select few people with advantages to sell their items more effectively than few users?
