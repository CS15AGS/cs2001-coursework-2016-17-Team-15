## Welcome to Team 15's Repository!
* This is the _literal_ GitHub repository for CS2001-2016/17 Team 15, as it appears there are two. 
- It is also the _best_ one.

#### Team Members (A-Z)
* Ashish
* Edzel
* James
* Joffin
* Johnny
* Mamunah

#### To-do List
- Discuss an appropriate meetup time excluding CS2001 lab sessions and tutor meetup times.
- Discuss whether to use Skype, TeamSpeak or Discord for alternative means of communication/collaboration.
- _Get some sleep._

#### Note to Members
- The 'master' branch is _literally_, the master branch. This should contain the most up-to-date & valid work.
- Feel free to fork the 'master' branch if you wish to make changes/updates to the current work.
- To merge your work with the 'master' branch, please submit a 'pull' request so the group will be updated on new changes, and we can then merge them correctly.
