#### Note to Members
- The 'master' branch is _literally_ the master branch. This should contain the most up-to-date & valid work.
- Feel free to fork the 'master' branch if you wish to make changes/updates to the current work.
- To merge your **coding** work with the 'master' branch, please submit a 'pull' request so the group will be updated on new changes, and we can then merge them correctly.
- Remember to constantly save an up-to-date copy of the repository on your local computer so that you may have an extra backup if GitHub is temporarily down.
