## Welcome to Team 15's Repository!
* Behold the _literal_ GitHub repository for CS2001-2016/17 Team 15, as it appears there are two. 

#### Team Members (A-Z)
* Ashish
* Edzel
* James
* Joffin
* Johnny
* Mamunah

#### To-do List
- We should move toward the development of the mobile prototype demo.
- Discuss architecture of the app? Find out possible technologies to use? E.g. MySQL, Lucene, Hadoop etc...
- Discuss an appropriate meetup time excluding CS2001 lab sessions and tutor meetup times.
- Discuss whether to use Skype, TeamSpeak or Discord for alternative means of communication/collaboration.
- ~~Get some sleep.~~
- Add or edit more use cases. Apparently our current use cases have some slight error. Feel free to improve it!
- Conduct analysis on real-world transactions in applications.
- Decide on the transaction process for the application.
- Add usability engineering depth on UI designs.

#### Note to Members
- The 'master' branch is _literally_ the master branch. This should contain the most up-to-date & valid work.
- Feel free to fork the 'master' branch if you wish to make changes/updates to the current work.
- To merge your work with the 'master' branch, please submit a 'pull' request so the group will be updated on new changes, and we can then merge them correctly.
- Also, if you are attempting to upload a more latest version of a file, be sure to give it the same name so it is overwritten and no duplicates are left.
