## Welcome to Team 15's Repository!
* Behold the _literal_ GitHub repository for CS2001-2016/17 Team 15, as it appears there are two.

#### Notifications (Last Updated:1/12/16)
- The group has recently **adopted** an incremental agile methodology. Though this is later to be specified in the following meeting.
- We have finished **finalizing** the UI designs.
- Uploaded the **Android Project folder**, all activity classes have been added, along with their layouts, as well as registered in the manifest .xml file. All layouts set to LinearLayout.

#### TO-DO List (In order)
- To be discussed promptly.

#### Note to Members
- The 'master' branch is _literally_ the master branch. This should contain the most up-to-date & valid work.
- Feel free to fork the 'master' branch if you wish to make changes/updates to the current work.
- To merge your **coding** work with the 'master' branch, please submit a 'pull' request so the group will be updated on new changes, and we can then merge them correctly.
- Remember to constantly save an up-to-date copy of the repository on your local computer so that you may have an extra backup if GitHub is temporarily down.
