## Welcome to Team 15's Repository!
* Behold the _literal_ GitHub repository for CS2001-2016/17 Team 15, as it appears there are two. 

#### Team Members (A-Z)
* Ashish
* Edzel
* James
* Joffin
* Johnny
* Mamunah

#### To-do List (In order)
1. **Complete** UI prototyping design with discussed amendments.
2. **Decide** on the name for the application.
3. **Find** a time/place to meet (real-world/online).

#### Note to Members
- The 'master' branch is _literally_ the master branch. This should contain the most up-to-date & valid work.
- Feel free to fork the 'master' branch if you wish to make changes/updates to the current work.
- To merge your work with the 'master' branch, please submit a 'pull' request so the group will be updated on new changes, and we can then merge them correctly.
- Also, if you are attempting to upload a more latest version of a file, be sure to give it the same name so it is overwritten and no duplicates are left.
